Networking Fundamentals
1. The OSI Model
A seven-layer framework for understanding how networking systems communicate:

Application Layer: Provides services for user applications.
Presentation Layer: Manages data translation, encryption, and compression.
Session Layer: Establishes and maintains connections.
Transport Layer: Divides data into packets.
Network Layer: Selects the best/shortest routing path.
Data Link Layer: Converts packets into frames.
Physical Layer: Converts into bit streams (binary) and sends via mediums like Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
2. TCP/IP Model
Application
Transport
Internet Layer
Network Access Layer
3. Networking Devices
Devices facilitating network management:

Hub: Broadcasts data to all connected devices (Layer 1).
Bridge: Filters traffic based on MAC addresses (Layer 2).
Switch: Intelligent traffic management with high port count (Layer 2).
Router: Routes data across networks using IP addresses (Layer 3).

Bus Topology: Single cable connecting devices.
Star Topology: Devices connect to a central hub.
Ring Topology: Devices form a circular connection.
Mesh Topology: Each device connects to every other.
Hybrid Topology: Combines multiple topologies.
5. Types of Networks
LAN (Local Area Network): Covers small areas (e.g., offices).
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): Connects multiple LANs within a city.
WAN (Wide Area Network): Spans large geographic areas (e.g., the Internet).
6. IP Addressing
IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334).

Key terms:

Network ID: The starting address of an IP range.
Broadcast ID: The ending address of an IP range.
Subnet Mask: Defines internal network boundaries.

7. Protocols: TCP vs UDP
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable data transmission.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Fast but less reliable.
